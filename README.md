# LoginSystem
Simple user login system using PHP &amp; an OOP Approach with PDO Extension

Following on from a univeristy coursework i have started implement a basic admin panel with integrated login system using OOP.

dbconfig.php is meant to be in the db folder but due to problems not accessing the database i have taken it out for the time being. Once fixed the file will be back in the folder along with 'Classes'.
